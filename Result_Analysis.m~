% Determine where your m-file's folder is.
folder = fileparts(which(mfilename)); 
% Add that folder plus all subfolders to the path.

% CHOOSE RESULT
%{
The user can choose the results to analyse setting "ResultName" among the
files stored in the directory "./results".
Results will be automatically loaded in the workspace as a struct "RES"
previously generated running the MAIN script.

%% PERFORMANCE METRICS LINE PLOTS
%{
The following function returns 4 figures containing the analysis of the
four performance metrics:
    - Accuracy 
    - Sensitivity
    - Precision
    - F1 score
The script loads the results of the training generated in the MAIN script
and automatically passes the workspace saved struct "RES" to the function
"PerformanceMetrics_LinePlot" that closes all open figures and
